The following AWS certificates should be stored in this directory:
	#####-certificate.pem.crt
	#####-private.pem.key
	#####-public.pem.key
	rootCA.pem.crt

These can be generated in the AWS IoT Console area to manage "things"

The "#####" in the filename should be replaced with the UID of the certificate/key-pairs

The same files should be stored in both the lambda and client folders.

Likewise, the awsmqtt-config.json should be the same.  The topic name stored there should be unique across all topics in the broker.
I just use the Alexa skill ARN.  Its verbose, but should be unique.
